# Problem 1
dissolved oxygen concentration 
$0-50 km$ waste stream 1 

``` julia 
#given 

# m^3/day
Qr= 100000; #river
Q1 = 10000; # waste 1
Q2 = 15000; # waste 2

# mg/L
DOr = 7.5;
DO1 = 5;
DO2 = 5;

CBODr = 5;
CBOD1 = 50;
CBOD2 = 45;

NBODr = 5;
NBOD1 = 35;
NBOD2 = 35;

U = 6; #km/day
ka = 0.55; #1/day Reairation rate
kc = 0.35; #1/day CBOD decay
kn = 0.25; #1/day NBOD decay
Cs = 10; # mg/L O2 concentration (saturated) 
``` 
## Problem 1.1
### If the characteristics of the river inflow and waste discharges are given in the table
### above, plot the dissolved oxygen concentration in the river from the first waste source
#### to 50 km downstream.
``` julia 
# distance 
x = 0:1:50; # in km from waste 1
D0 = zeros(length(x)); CBOD = zeros(length(x)); NBOD = zeros(length(x));

# concentrations after waste 1 in mg/L
C01_1 = (Qr*DOr + Q1*DO1) / (Qr+Q1); 
B01_1 = (Qr*CBODr + Q1*CBOD1) / (Qr+Q1); 
N01_1 = (Qr*NBODr + Q1*NBOD1) / (Qr+Q1); 


function DO_conc(Cs, C0, B0, N0, ka, kc, kn, x, U)
  a1 = exp(-ka*x)
  a2 = (kc/(ka-kc))*(exp(-kc*x/U)-exp(-ka*x/U))
  a3 = (kn/(ka-kn))*(exp(-kn*x/U)-exp(-ka*x/U))
  C = Cs*(1-a1)+C0*(a1-B0)*(a2-N0)*a3
  return C
end 


# for 0-14 km
for i in 1:16
  D0[i] = DO_conc( Cs, C01_1, B01_1, N01_1, ka, kc, kn, x[i], U);
  CBOD[i] = B01_1*exp(-kc*x[i]/U);
  NBOD[i] = N01_1*exp(-kn*x[i]/U);
end 

# for 15-50 km (waste stream 2)
C02_1 = (DO[16]*(Qr+Q1) + DO2*Q2) / (Qr + Q1 + Q2);
B02_1 = (CBOD[16]*(Qr+Q1) + CBOD2*Q2) / (Qr + Q1 + Q2);
N02_1 = (NBOD[16]*(Qr+Q1) + NBOD2*Q2) / (Qr + Q1 + Q2);


for i in 16:51
  D0[i] = DO_conc( Cs, C02_1, B02_1, N02_1, ka, kc, kn, x[i]-15, U);
end

#plot
using Plots
plot(x,DO, title="DO Along Stream", label="Dissolved Oxygen", xlabel="Distance (km)", ylabel="Concentration (mg/L)")

```
## Problem 1.2
### Under the assumptions in Problem 1.1, determine the distance from waste stream 2 it
### will take for the dissolved oxygen concentration of the river to recover to 6 mg/L if
### both waste streams are untreated

Based on previous problem, assume DO concentration recovers to 6 mg/L in between 35 and 45 km. 
``` julia
val = 6;
tol = 0.001;
L = 35;
R = 45; 

# using bisection
while R - L > tol 
  mid = (R+L)/2
  Do_mid = DO_conc(Cs, C02_1, B02_1, N02_1, ka, kc, kn, mid-15, U);
  if Do_mid == val  
    break
  elseif Do_mod < val 
    global L = mid
  else 
    global R = mid
  end
end 

#recovery distance
recov_dist = (R+L)/2 - 15;
print(recov_dist)
```
Dissolved Oxygen recovers to 6 mg/L at ~41.2 km.
26.2 km from waste 2. 

## Problem 1.3
### What is the minimum level of treatment (% removal of the organic waste) for waste
### stream 2 that will ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration never drops below
### 4 mg/L, assuming that waste stream 1 remains untreated?
start at 0% and increase by 0.1% 
``` julia
DO_3 = DO[1:51];
treatment = 0;
while minimum(DO_3) < 4
  global treatment = treatment + 0.001; 

  #waste 2 
  CBOD2_3 = (1-treatment) * CBOD2;
  NBOD2_3 = (1-treatment) * NBOD2;

  # river content after waste 2
  B02_3 = (CBOD[16]*(Qr+Q1) + CBOD2_3*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);
  N02_3 = (NBOD[16]*(Qr+Q1) + NBOD2_3*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);

  #DO after river and waste 2
  for i in 16:51
    DO_3[i] = DO_conc(Cs, C02_1, B02_3, N02_3, ka, kc, kn, x[i]-15, U)
  end
end

print(treatment)

```

Treatment level of Waste 2 to keep DO conc above 4 mg/L is 11.7%

## Problem 1.4
### If both waste streams are treated equally, what is the minimum level of treatment (% removal) of the two sources required to ensure that the dissolved oxygen concentration
### never drops below 4 mg/L?
``` julia
DO_4 = DO[1:51];
treatment2 = 0;
while minimum(DO_4) < 4
  global treatment2 = treatment2 + 0.001; 

#waste 1 
  CBOD1_4 = (1-treatment2) * CBOD1;
  NBOD1_4 = (1-treatment2) * NBOD1;

  # river content after waste 1
  B01_4 = (Qr*CBODr + Q1*CBOD1_4) / (Qr+Q1);
  N01_4 = (Qr*NBODr + Q1*NBOD1_4) / (Qr+Q1);

# for 0-14 km
  for i in 16:51
    DO_4[i] = DO_conc(Cs, C01_1, B01_4, N01_4, ka, kc, kn, x[i], U)
  end

  #waste 2 
  CBOD2_4 = (1-treatment2) * CBOD2;
  NBOD2_4 = (1-treatment2) * NBOD2;

  # river content after waste 2
  CBOD_15t = B01_4*exp(-kc*15/U);
  NBOD_15t = N01_4*exp(-kn*15/U);
  C02_4 = (DO_4[16]*(Qr+Q1) + DO2*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);
  B02_4 = (CBOD_15t*(Qr+Q1) + CBOD2_3*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);
  N02_4 = (NBOD_15t*(Qr+Q1) + NBOD2_3*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);

  #DO after river and waste 2
  for i in 16:51
    DO_4[i] = DO_conc(Cs, C02_4, B02_4, N02_4, ka, kc, kn, x[i]-15, U)
  end
end


print(treatment2)
```

minimum level of treatment to both streams is 6.6%
## Problem 1.5
### Suppose you were responsible for waste treatment along the river, with a regulatory
### mandate to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L. Discuss whether
### youâ€™d opt to treat waste stream 2 alone or both waste streams equally. What other
### information might you need to make a conclusion, if any
For 1.3 and 1.4, we can treat waste 2 with 11.7% organics removal but if we want to treat waste 1 and waste 2
at the same time we need to account for 6.6% removal in both. Assume a linear relationship 
we should treat waste 2 only. We would only pay for 11.7% removal instead of 13.2% total. 

This could be inaccurate if not a linear relationship or if the cost is not a direct reflection of the % removal total. 

## Problem 1.6
### Suppose now that the CBOD and NBOD values of the river inflow are uncertain. Suppose that your estimates of CBOD vary uniformly between 4 and 7 mg/L, and NBOD
### estimates vary uniformly between 3 and 8 mg/L. If you assume these values are independent, what is the probability that the strategy you identified in Problem 1.5 will
### fail to keep the dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L?

Chose just to treat waste 2. Redo 1.1 with treatment and test over (4-7 mg/L) CBOD and (3-8 mg/L) NBOD. 
``` julia
fails = 0; 

treatment = 0.117;
CBOD2_6 = (1-treatment)*CBOD2;
NBOD2_6 = (1-treatment)*NBOD2;

# conc range in river
CBOD_range = 4:0.01:7;
NBOD_range = 3:0.01:8;

for i in 1:length(CBOD_range)
  for j in 1:length(NBOD_range)
    CBOD_6 = CBOD_range[i];
    NBOD_6 = NBOD_range[j];
    DO_6 = zeros(length(x));

    B01_6 = (Qr*CBOD_6 + Q1*CBOD1) / (Qr+Q1);
    N01_6 = (Qr*NBOD_6 + Q1*NBOD1) / (Qr+Q1);

    # for 0-14 km
    for i in 1:16
      DO_6[i] = DO_conc(Cs, C01_1, B01_6, N01_6, ka, kc, kn, x[i], U);
    end

    # for 15-50 km
    CBOD2_river = B01_6*exp(-kc*15/U);
    NBOD2_river = N01_6*exp(-kn*15/U);
    C02_6 = (DO_6[16]*(Qr+Q1) + DO2*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);
    B02_6 = (CBOD2_river*(Qr+Q1) + CBOD2_6*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);
    N02_6 = (NBOD2_river*(Qr+Q1) + NBOD2_6*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);

    for i in 16:51
      DO_6[i] = DO_conc(Cs, C02_6, B02_6, N02_6, ka, kc, kn, x[i], U);
    end

    if minimum(DO_6) < 4
      global fails = fails + 1;
    end
  end
end

#probability
prob = fails/length(CBOD_range)*length(NBOD_range));
print(prob)

```

the probability of the strategy failing is 11%


## Problem 1.7
### Now suppose that the CBOD and NBOD values are correlated: specifically, they have
### a correlation coefficient of 0.7. How does that impact the probability of maintaining a dissolved oxygen concentration above 4 mg/L under the treatment strategy
### from Problems 1.5? The solution template includes a code block defining a function
### sample_correlated_uniform() that you can use to produce correlated uniform
### variates.

use given function (sample_correlated_uniform) to randomly select 10,000 samples and redo 1.6 calculations
```julia; echo=false
# This block will not show up in compiled output.

using Distributions
using PDMats

# This function samples n correlated variates distributed over 
# Uniform([a[1], a[2]]) and Uniform([b[1], b[2]]) with correlation coefficient
# corr_coef.
function sample_correlated_uniform(n, a, b, corr_coef=0.7)
  mvnorm = MvNormal([0, 0], PDMat([1 corr_coef; corr_coef 1])) # set up a multivariate normal with each marginal variance of 1 and the right correlation
  norm_samples = rand(mvnorm, n)' # sample from the multivariate normal, the marginal distributions are a standard normal
  unif_samples = cdf.(Normal(0, 1), norm_samples) # convert samples to a uniform distribution using the pdf of a standard Normal
  samples = (unif_samples .* [a[2] - a[1] b[2] - b[1]]) .+ [a[1] b[1]]
  return samples
end
```

``` julia
fails_7 = 0;
n = 10000;

treatment = 0.117;
CBOD2_7 = (1-treatment)*CBOD2;
NBOD2_7 = (1-treatment)*NBOD2;

samples = sample_correlated_uniform(n, [4,7], [3,8], 0.7);

for i in 1:n
  
  CBOD_7 = samples[i,1];
  NBOD_7 = samples[i,2];
  DO_7 = zeros(length(x));

  B01_7 = (Qr*CBOD_7 + Q1*CBOD1) / (Qr+Q1);
  N01_7 = (Qr*NBOD_7 + Q1*NBOD1) / (Qr+Q1);

    # for 0-14 km
    for i in 1:16
      DO_7[i] = DO_conc(Cs, C01_1, B01_7, N01_7, ka, kc, kn, x[i], U);
    end

    # for 15-50 km
    CBOD2_river = B01_7*exp(-kc*15/U);
    NBOD2_river = N01_7*exp(-kn*15/U);
    C02_7 = (DO_7[16]*(Qr+Q1) + DO2*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);
    B02_7 = (CBOD2_river*(Qr+Q1) + CBOD2_7*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);
    N02_7 = (NBOD2_river*(Qr+Q1) + NBOD2_7*Q2) / (Qr+Q1+Q2);

    for i in 16:51
      DO_7[i] = DO_conc(Cs, C02_7, B02_7, N02_7, ka, kc, kn, x[i], U);
    end

    if minimum(DO_7) < 4
      global fails_7 = fails_7 + 1;
    end
end


#probability
prob_7 = fails/length(CBOD_range)*length(NBOD_range));
print(prob_7)

```

the probability of the strategy failing is about 20% after several runs

## Problem 1.8
### Discuss how the presence of uncertainty and dependence between variables might
### affect your decision-making process. Would you stick with the same strategy as in
### Problem 1.5, or find a new strategy? What other information would you need, if any?
Uncertainty makes the strategy of just choosing waste 2 organic removal fail where it would have met the standard. 
The relationship between CBOD and NBOC increased probability of failure. 

I would change straetgies and would address uncertainity with a range of confidence. Here I could analyze my outputs with mean and standard deviations to make sure it was accurate.
